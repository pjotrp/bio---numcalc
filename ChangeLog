* VectorTools function templates updated and simplified. New weighted
  functions (mean, var, cov, cor, etc.)
* NunTools is now a fully templated static class.

06/07/07 -*- Version 1.3.0 -*-

16/06/07 Julien Dutheil
* DataTable is now Clonable, with appropriate copy constructor and assigment
operator.

29/05/05 Julien Dutheil
* Numerical derivative improved.

26/05/07 Julien Dutheil
* Conjugate gradient method added + numerical derivative classes improved.
* New nmerical derivatives "two points" method.

04/05/07 Nicolas Galtier & Julien Dutheil
* Namespace VectorFunction is removed, and static class VectorTools used
instead.
* New container functions in VectorTools.

18/04/07 Julien Dutheil
* Optimizers are now event-driven. AbstractOptimizer class improved.
* Constraint support in class Parameter improved: pointer is no more constant,
	and the constraint may be attached or not (the default, previous behaviour).

11/04/07 Julien Dutheil
* DirectionFunction improved and in a sperate class.
  Powel optimizer modified and improved.
* Function classes augmented: new methods enableFirst(Second)OrderDerivatives.
  Numerical derivatives classes improved: faster computation, no analytical
	derivatives computed when computing function at other points.

03/04/07 Benoît Nabholz & Julien Dutheil
* Bug fixed in numerical derivatives classes: derivatives properly computed
  when constraint matched.
* New method setConstraint in class Parameter.

02/04/07 Julien Dutheil
* VIRTUAL_COV variable changed to NO_VIRTUAL_COV. configure.ac file updated.
  => Default behaviour is now /really/ to use covariant return type with
	virtual inheritence, even when importing the files in an IDE. To use the old
	compilers behaviour, one must set the NO_VIRTUAL_COV preproc variable.
* Optimizer interface now has a 'isInitialized' method, and send an exception
  when attempting to optimize without properly initializing the optimizer.
	Similar behaviour is set for the setInitialInterval method in
	one-dimensional optimizers.

19/02/07 Julien Dutheil
* Parametrizable interface now inherits from Clonable.

19/01/07 -*- Version 1.2.0 -*-

30/12/06 Julien Dutheil
* --enable-virtual-cov option in configure, set to yes by default.
* The Function interface now inherits from Clonable (bpp-utils).
* Constraint interface now inherits from Clonable.
* Optimizer interface now inherits from Clonable.
* OptimizationStopCondition interface now inherits from Clonable.
* Bug fixed in RowMatrix<T>: double changed to T in resize function. 

24/11/06 Julien Dutheil
* New function randC in DiscreteDistribution.

26/10/06 Benoît Nabholz
* New median function in VectorTools.

28/08/06 -*- Version 1.1.0 -*-

17/08/06 Julien Dutheil
* Corrected method name in InfinityWrapper function: getParameter->getParameterValue.
* New classes for numerical derivative computations: 3 and 5 points methods.

07/08/06 Julien Dutheil
* New function kroneckerMult and kroneckerSum in MatrixTools.
* New function kroneckerMult in VectorTools.
* Namespaces VectorStatTools was merged with VectorFunctions.
* All functions and operator in VectorTools are templates.
  Removed overrding with Vdouble, and use template specialisation for
  <InputType,OutputType> and <IntputType,OutputType=InputType>.
* New operators "scalar [+-*/] vector" in VectorTools.

01/06/06 Julien Dutheil
* new operators (string,int) and (int,string) in DataTable.

22/05/05 Julien Dutheil
* [Row,Column,""]NameNotFoundException now displays the invalid name in what().

07/05/06 Julien Dutheil
* Domain.getIndex now has unsigned int return type.

02/05/06 Julien Dutheil
* Added methods hasColumn and hasRow in DataTable.

18/04/06 -*- Version 1.0.1 -*-

18/04/06 Julien Dutheil
* Eigen: Bug fixed in header file.
* RandomTools: Changed default generator for compatibility with x64.
